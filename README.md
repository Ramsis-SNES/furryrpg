# Furry RPG! (Working Title)

Welcome to Furry RPG!, an all-new Japanese-style role-playing game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, or SNES. The game is currently in development.

### Implemented features:

* Epic storyline spanning over multiple realms, featuring an all-Furry cast.
* 48 Mbit ROM size (ExHiROM) with SRAM-based game save support (think *Tales of Phantasia*). ROM expansion to 64 or even 96 Mbit may or may not be necessary in the future depending on the need for fitting all game data.
* Extendable scripting language supporting up to 32,768 commands ("event codes").
* High resolution, VWF-based multi-language dialog rendering engine, complete with character portrait, background color gradient, and *Suikoden*-style selection bar support.
* Fully controllable, Mode-7-based "flying" animation with rotating sky background.
* Fully controllable, Mode-1-based world map with scrolling displacement and horizon curvature effects, simulating a planet surface (think *Treasure Hunter G*).
* Extendable area loading engine (four/eight-directional scrolling is WIP) with fully working sprite-to-BG collision detection support.
* Full-fledged and easily extendable sprite animation engine.
* High-quality, SNESGSS-based soundtrack engine with audio streaming support.
* Optional ambient sound effects featuring real recordings thanks to MSU-1 support (only available on advanced emulators/flashcarts like higan/bsnes and SD2SNES).
* Optional real-time clock support (only available on certain emulators and advanced flashcarts like higan/bsnes and SD2SNES).
* ... and more!

### Planned features:

* More or less open world (story-related restrictions apply).
* Several endings, each requiring the player to make specific choices during the course of the game.
* Homebase building (think *Breath of Fire II,* *Suikoden*).
* Optional, mostly unmissable sidequests (think *Chrono Trigger*).
* Day/night cycle (even when no RTC available).
* Daytime-related special events.
* Semi-realtime battle system with different "special gauges" for each character.
* Full-screen cutscenes, maybe even FMV (only when MSU-1 is available).
* Character sympathy/affection score system impacting game events and/or endings.
* Log/notebook providing hints (once acquired) on what to do next.
* Unlockable character and cut scene galleries/sound test/mini games/special features/you name it.
