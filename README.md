# Furry RPG! (Working Title)

Welcome to *Furry RPG!,* an all-new Japanese-style role-playing game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). The game is currently in development (on and off, see down below).

### Implemented features

* Epic storyline spanning over multiple realms, featuring an all-Furry cast.
* 48 Mbit ROM size (ExHiROM) with SRAM-based game save support (think *Tales of Phantasia*). ROM expansion to 64 or even 96 Mbit may or may not be necessary in the future depending on the need for fitting all game data.
* Extendable scripting language supporting up to 32,768 commands ("event codes").
* High resolution, VWF-based multi-language dialogue rendering engine, complete with character portrait, background color gradient, and *Suikoden*-style selection bar support.
* Fully controllable, Mode-7-based "flying" animation with rotating sky background.
* Fully controllable, Mode-1-based world map with scrolling displacement and horizon curvature effects, simulating a planet surface (think *Treasure Hunter G*).
* Extendable area loading engine (four/eight-directional scrolling is WIP) with fully working sprite-to-BG collision detection support.
* Full-fledged and easily extendable sprite animation engine (WIP).
* High-quality, SNESGSS-based soundtrack engine with audio streaming support (WIP).
* Optional ambient sound effects featuring real recordings thanks to MSU-1 support (only available on certain emulators and advanced flashcarts like SD2SNES/FXPAK PRO).
* Optional real-time clock support (only available on certain emulators and advanced flashcarts like SD2SNES/FXPAK PRO).
* ... and more!

### Planned features

* More or less open world (story-related restrictions apply).
* Several endings, each requiring the player to make specific choices during the course of the game.
* Homebase building (think *Breath of Fire II,* *Suikoden*).
* Optional, mostly unmissable sidequests (think *Chrono Trigger*).
* Day/night cycle (even when no RTC available).
* Daytime-related special events.
* Semi-realtime battle system with different "special gauges" for each character.
* Full-screen cutscenes, maybe even FMV (only when MSU-1 is available).
* Character sympathy/affection score system impacting game events and/or endings.
* Log/notebook providing hints (once acquired) on what to do next.
* Unlockable character and cut scene galleries/sound test/mini games/special features/you name it.

### Last but not least

Please bear in mind that this is a personal project, which I'm working on in my very limited spare time, so there's no ETA. Instead of getting the game out as fast as possible, the goal of *Furry RPG!* is more of an educational one. I enjoy documenting my knowledge and improving my skills in programming the SNES and working with its limited hardware resources, and hope that others might benefit from it as well.

Then again, I'd be more than happy to see the project one day evolve from a (sort of) SNES tech demo into a full-fledged RPG that is playable from start to finish, so if you happen to be a furry designer/illustrator and/or graphics/pixel artist, you are welcome to contribute to this open-source freeware project, especially since I'm hopeless at creating graphics myself. ;-) If you feel your skills could be of help, please contact me by e-mail (ramsis @ the domain name of my [website](https://manuloewe.de/).

Thanks, and happy retrogaming! :-)
